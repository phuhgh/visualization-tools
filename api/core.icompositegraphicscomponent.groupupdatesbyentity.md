## ICompositeGraphicsComponent.groupUpdatesByEntity property

Instead of batching entities into update groups based on the subcomponents, update entities in turn cycling through the subcomponents. With large shared buffers and few entities this can significantly improve performance.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
readonly groupUpdatesByEntity: boolean;
```

## Remarks

When this is true it applies to any nested composite component as well. Graphics components should be linked using [linkGraphicsComponents()](./core.linkgraphicscomponents.md) in this case.
